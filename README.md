# Learn-Relay
Start with a react component and produce a graphQL server to accommodate it's needs.

We assume you have an understanding of React for this tutorial.

## Start With A simple React Component

We will start with a basic component, a cinema ticket.

It requires the following props:
* seat
* movie - An object with fields title and rating
* ticketType - An object with fields name and price

We want to be able to fetch the data from an external source using Relay.

## Wrap it in a Relay container!
